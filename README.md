# 🕵️‍♂️ PDF Alchemist: The Arcane PDF to HTML Transmuter 📜🌐

Welcome to the enigmatic realm of PDF Alchemist, where the secrets of PDFs are transmuted into the digital gold of HTML.

## 🌟 Project Overview

PDF Alchemist is a sophisticated, open-source toolkit that combines the arcane arts of PDF parsing, OCR, image processing, and HTML generation. It's designed for those who seek to unlock the knowledge sealed within the enigmatic tomes we call PDFs.

This project brings together a fellowship of powerful components:

- **PDFParser**: The Document Detective, powered by [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF)
- **OCREngine**: The Text Archaeologist, empowered by [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
- **ImageProcessor**: The Digital Alchemist, enhanced by [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
- **HTMLGenerator**: The Web Illusionist, crafted with [Dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)
- **ProgressTracker**: The Expedition Chronicler, utilizing Python's built-in [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module

## ✨ Capabilities

- Unearth text and images from PDF archives
- Decipher text using advanced OCR incantations
- Transmute images into optimized, base64-encoded artifacts
- Weave extracted elements into responsive HTML tapestries
- Chronicle the expedition with detailed logs and progress tracking

## 🧪 Installation

To establish your own PDF Alchemist's laboratory:

1. Clone this arcane repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/team-bitfuture/pdf-alchemist.git
   ```
2. Enter the sacred circle:
   ```
   cd pdf-alchemist
   ```
3. Summon the required artifacts:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Ensure you possess the [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) grimoire. If not, acquire it [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

## 🔮 Usage

To initiate the PDF transmutation ritual:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_path = "input.pdf" 
    output_dir = "output"
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True) 
    main(pdf_path, output_dir)
```

This will transmute your PDF into a series of HTML pages, complete with extracted text, images, and layout information.

## 🧬 Running Tests

To ensure your PDF Alchemist is operating at peak efficiency:

```
pytest tests/
```

This will execute a series of arcane trials, testing each component of the PDF Alchemist.
